Bancada Mitica 2.0 - Aquisition Code for Arduino Boards

The *Bancada Mitica 2.0* eletronics use the concept of [Sensor Hubs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensor_hub), where there's one or more boards (called Sources) responsible for adquiring data from sensors, and there's one central board (called Sink) responsible for receiving data from Sources, processing and forwarding it.

This repository contais the code for the Source boards.

Those Source boards currently include Load Cells (through HX711) and Pitots (through MPXV7002DP and ADS1115).
